I try to take the assignments and create more of a dynamic enviroment for me to play in, while understandin the simple concepts of the assignment. I want to create something more unique to challange my skill level and understanding of the concepts. Think, expanding upon the current assignment. However, I also want to have fun and create something I actually enjoy writing as well. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did creating it."

    "Doing some quick research, as this was my first time doing this in python specifically for osx/windows, I found that this allows clearing of terminal outputs in Jupyter Notebooks. I did pull this concept from stack exchange. This was my first time making sure that the terminal could clear whether it was os or Nt (windows due to NT kernal). First, we defined the clear function so this code is much simipler to use on the fly. Saves memory, and makes it easier to read. We use the ternary operator for a conditional expression to decide if the command we are giving is 'cls' or 'clear'. \n",
